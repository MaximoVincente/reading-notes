# "Ethics in Tech" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

### "The Code I'm Ashamed Of"

This article really stuck to me. This happened in early 2000's when technology was not as advanced as it is today. It does not matter the targeted audience, but to think that it was teenage girls being targeted is sickening. At such age that their still trying to figure out who they are, and to have a quiz misinforming them on their decision to something that it is supposed to help you is taking advantage of someone's vulnerability. I am glad that the developer resign after that, when he realized how unethical it was. I am sure we ill one day be on a similar position, it is important to remember that we have a choice, we all mention how we want to be Developers to help others in a positive way, I think ethics is a great way to start to remember one of your reasons you decided to become a developer.

### "Microsoft Employees Protest Work With ICE, as Tech Industry Mobilizes Over Immigration"

Having both of my parents come to the USA as immigrants, made this article feel personal. When I was 5, my father was deported, leaving my mother alone to raise 3 children. My father had a noble job, and had no reason to be deported, other than not having a residency, which he was at the time getting legal help to become a US resident. That is why I had to grow up in the Dominican Republic, which did not have all the opportunities given in the USA, but I am grateful that my experience growing up in DR was great and I got to grow up with my parents. 
As a developer, it is our responsibility to take a stand just like the Microsoft's employees did.
