# ‚ÄúRelated Data in Spring and Integration Testing‚Äù Reading Notes üìñ

We define a one-to-many relationship using the OneToMany and ManyToOne annotations. We can also add the optional RestResource annotation to customize the association resource.

- The relationship is added to the class. 
- Then we create an instance by using the resource, and create the association endpoint
- Then we verify with the GET method. 

Integration testing plays an important role in the application development cycle by verifying the end-to-end behavior of a system.

- To prepare for integration testing well need dependencies and junit-jupiter-engine, junit jupiter API and Spring test dependencies 
- Next we configure and run Spring enabled tests by adding the @ExtendWith annotation to our test classes and specifying the extension class to load. To run the Spring test, we use SpringExtension.class. We'll also need the @ContextConfiguration annotation to load the context configuration and bootstrap the context that our test will use.
- Next we need the WebApplicationContext Object to load all the application beans and controllers in the context.
- Verify Test Configuration
