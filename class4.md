# "Structure Web Pages with HTML" Reading Notes 📖

## HTML

- HTML contains elements and tags.
- You start HTML with `<!DOCTYPE html>`. This is an element.
  - Followed by
  - `<html lang="en"></html>`. This is to open HTML, and set language to English. Then Close HTML.
  - `<head>`
  - `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
  - `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`
  - `<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">`
  - `<title>YOUR TITLE</title>` **Your title**
  - `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`
  - `</head>`
  - `<body></body>` **Open and close Body** `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` goes inside the body.
  - `<header></header>` **Open and close Header**
  - `<img src=”link” alt=”description”/>` is to add an image.
  - `<a href = "link3"> Topic3 </a>` is for adding a link.
  - `<section>` will add a section within main.
  - Header size range from `<h1></h1>` (biggest) to `<h6></h6>` for smallest header size.
  - `<p></p>` to add a paragraph.
  - `<nav></nav>` for navigation links.
  - `<ul><li></li></ul>` for unordered lists.

### Wireframing

- Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.
- Wireframing is also a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.
- Before you even think about picking up a pen and paper, you need to have covered the first two steps; namely understanding who your audience is by way of user research, detailing requirements,creating user personas and defining use cases, and complementing this with further competitor and industry research. **Working on The Business Acumen Competence can relate to this**

- Wireframe is needed prior to coding. Changes are much easier to make while building your wireframe.
- Color of fancy test wont matter if you don’t have a wireframe.
- Wireframes can be drawn by hands, or use software. You can start with manually designing it, then later build it in the software.
- different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:
  - Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
  - Sketch > Code
  - Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
  - Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code
- **Prepare to research!**
- A few choice quotes from your audience might also help focus your attention on the user’s experience, which is—never forget—what you’re designing!
- Good information architecture will ensure that your users are self-sufficient (fewer messages to your customer service asking how to do something painfully simple), lower levels of user frustration (and ultimately more satisfaction and trust), and therefore lower drop-off or drop-out rates.
- Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate pose yourself the following three questions while you’re sketching:
  - How can you organise the content to support your users’ goals?
  - Which information should be most prominent? Where should your main message go? What should the user see first when arriving at the page?
  - What will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page?
  - Which buttons or touch points does the user need to complete the desired actions?
- Attractiveness at this stage (Wireframing) is not a consideration.
