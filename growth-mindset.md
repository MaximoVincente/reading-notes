> ***Growth Mindset for me are the challenges, on what you are trying to learn or accomplish, but understanding that each challenge will turn into knowledge, to achieve your end state.***

- I believe that growth mindset can be accomplished by:
  - Remembering that it is just a temporary hurdle, and I will see the positive outcome at the end!
  - Being curious
  - Understanding that you do not know everything, "yet"!

## Emotional Intelligence

My score for the emotional intelligence was higher than 18, but there were categories that I can improveÂ on, like self awareness, and social awareness. I think this is an important assessment to do since in our career field we will work with teams, and understanding the importance of each category can help create a psychologically safe team environment.  During the self-assessment, I based every decision based on my current career, and how in these situations in the past I thought, acted, or reacted. My relationship and self-management, were my higher score, and after scoring it, I thought on what were the tools and thought process I had during those scenarios, to keep enforcing it. Listening to my inner thoughts, and going through the process prior to acting has helped me in these areas, and being able to adapt.

## Assessing Bias

Based on my score it said that I have high self awareness, curiosity, and courage. Although there were areas that  were considered high score, I am aware, that in Bias and Identity, and Four ways to act I can improve on to be a better teammate. Some of the some questions made me think of situations that I have experienced, and what was my thought process then. I think it is important to have an honest assessment, especially coming from someone you trust, I take feedbacks well, but there have been situations of maybe a task that I am committed to and someone gives me a feedback and I was biased. I did think it through and realized that person did have a better approach and as I thought it through I acknowledged. I am glad that my colleagues trust me to be open on their thoughts and feedbacks.

## Things I want to Know More About

I would like to know how often would be a good timeframe to do the assessments in a team environment
