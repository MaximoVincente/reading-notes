# "RecyclerView for displaying lists of data" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

1. What database engine is Room wrapped around? Do you think this is a good choice? Why or why not?
   - Room is wrapped around SQLite. It is a good choice, it allows fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. 
   - It also provides the following benefits:
     - Compile-time verification of SQL queries.
     - Convenience annotations that minimize repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code.
     - Streamlined database migration paths.
2. Do Rooms have any similarities to JPA?
   - Room has a couple of similarities with JPA:
     - They both use Entities
     - They both use @ColumnInfo to represent rows in a data table.
3. Describe a DAO in your own words
   - DAO are the main classes to define our database interactions. They have different query methods like Insert, Delete, and Query. 

## Things I want to know more about

- I want to know if relationships are set the same way as im Spring.
