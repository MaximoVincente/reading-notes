## Don't Repeat Yourself

Don't repeat yourself also known as DRY, is aimed to reduce repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy. When the DRY principle is applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements.
The opposite of DRY is WET, also known as: write everything twice, write everytime, we enjoy typing, waste everyone's time. 
The other approach to abstraction is AHA or Avoid Hasty Abstractions. AHA programming assumes that both WET and DRY solutions inevitably create software that is rigid and difficult to maintain. Instead of starting with an abstraction, or abstracting at a specific number of duplications, software can be more flexible and robust if abstraction is done when it is needed, or, when the duplication itself has become the barrier and it is known how the abstraction needs to function.

## Rule of Three

The rule of three is the code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when similar pieces should be refactored to avoid duplications. With this rule if three instance of the similar code is used, it should be extracted into a new procedure. 

## You Aren't Gonna Need It

Is a principle which arose from extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary.

## Minimum Viable Product 

We have learned about MVP throughout Code Fellows with our final projects. It is a version of the application (in our case) with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can the provide feedback for future product development.
