# "Class 07" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

***This topic matters, because we no longer have to create many objects, giving each one a function, when we can store more on the same object and call the same methods***

## Domain Modeling

1. **Explain why we need domain modeling.**
   - A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.

## HTMBL Table Basics

1. **Why should tables not be used for page layouts?**
   - Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users: screen readers, used by blind people, interpret the tags that exist in an HTML page and read out the contents to the user. Because tables are not the right tool for layout, and the markup is more complex than with CSS layout techniques, the screen readers' output will be confusing to their users.
   - Tables produce tag soup: As mentioned above, table layouts generally involve more complex markup structures than proper layout techniques. This can result in the code being harder to write, maintain, and debug.
   - Tables are not automatically responsive: When you use proper layout containers (such as `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, or `<div>)`, their width defaults to 100% of their parent element. Tables on the other hand are sized according to their content by default, so extra measures are needed to get table layout styling to effectively work across a variety of devices.

2. **List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>.`**
   - The content of every table is enclosed by these two tags : `<table></table>`. Add these inside the body of your HTML.
   - The smallest container inside a table is a table cell, which is created by a `<td>` element ('td' stands for 'table data'). Each `<td>` element creates a single cell and together they make up the first row. Every cell we add makes the row grow longer.
   - To stop this row from growing and start placing subsequent cells on a second row, we need to use the `<tr>` element ('tr' stands for 'table row').

## Introducing Constructors

1. **What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?**
   - A constructor is just a function called using the new keyword. When you call a constructor, it will: create a new object, bind `this` to the new object, so you can refer to `this` in your constructor code, run the code in the constructorreturn the new object.
   Constructors, by convention, start with a capital letter and are named for the type of object they create.
2. **How does the term `this` differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?**
   - In a constructor, it will bind this to the new object, so we can can refer to `this` in the constructor code. In object literal, it enables you to use the same method definition for every object you create

## Object Prototype Using a Constructor

1. **Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.**
   - In the Army, it will be our standard operating procedures. Every unit has them, and it allows us to easily perform tasks, in the simplest way possible, and is accessible to everyone. There is no need to create another SOP, when there is one already made for you.
