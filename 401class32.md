# "AWS Amplify, Serverless, and GraphQL" Reading Notes üìñ

1. What makes an API RESTful?
   - It uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data is used to GET,POST, PUT, and DELETE, or we might also know it as CRUD. this architectural style is a representational state transfer
2. What is the benefit of using GraphQL? Any downsides?
   - It creates a consistent, predictable API you can use across all of your clients. As you add, remove, and migrate backend data stores, that API doesn't change from the client's perspective.  It's straightforward to add new types and fields to your API, and similarly straightforward for your clients to begin using those fields. This helps you design, develop, and deploy features quickly.
   - Some Disadvantages:
     - Change management
     - Potential for slow operations 
     - Incompatibility with web browser caching
3. Describe ‚Äúserverless‚Äù to a new 301 Code Fellows student.
   - Easiest explanation is that you do not need a server to host your application (personally), the service provides you with the server, and it is not tied to one server, so you can always have a better efficiency. It is the cloud lol
