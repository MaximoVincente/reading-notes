# "Java Imports and Arrays" Reading Notes ðŸ“–


Java has a two-fold type system consisting of primitives such as int, boolean and reference types such as Integer, Boolean. Every primitive type corresponds to a reference type. Choosing which object to use is going to be based on how much available memory we have, the amount of available memory and what default values we should handle.
Primitive type variables memory impact can vary depending on the virtual machine implementation.

Reference types are objects, they live on the heap and are relatively slow to access. The memory impact is much higher than primitives, with a single reference type occupying 128 bits, and long and double 192 bits.

Catch or Specify Requirement. This means that code that might throw certain exceptions must be enclosed by either of the following:

- A try statement that catches the exception.
- A method that specifies that it can throw the exception.

There are thre kinds of exceptions:

- The first kind of exception is the checked exception. These are exceptional conditions that a well-written application should anticipate and recover from.
- The second kind of exception is the error. These are exceptional conditions that are external to the application, and that the application usually cannot anticipate or recover from.
- The third kind of exception is the runtime exception. These are exceptional conditions that are internal to the application, and that the application usually cannot anticipate or recover from.

Objects of type Scanner are useful for breaking down formatted input into tokens and translating individual tokens according to their data type.

## Things I want to know more about

I would like to know more about scanning. The reading was a little vague, and it would be great to see a live demo on this topic.
