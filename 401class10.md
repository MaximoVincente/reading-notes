# "SpringMVC and Thymeleaf" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

#### SpringMVC

We start with Spring Initializr and manually initialize the project
   - Navigate to https://start.spring.io. This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.

   - Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. This guide assumes that you chose Java.

   - Click Dependencies and select Spring Web, Thymeleaf, and Spring Boot DevTools.

   - Click Generate.

   - Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices.

Next we create a web controller

   - In Springâ€™s approach to building web sites, HTTP requests are handled by a controller. You can easily identify the controller by the @Controller annotation.

Then Run the Application 
   - The Spring Initializr creates an application class for you. In this case, you need not further modify the class provided by the Spring Initializr.
