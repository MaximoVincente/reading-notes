**Although I have been using the terminal for four months daily, the were some new commands that I learned from the readings:**

- `~` THis shortcut for the home directory

***NOTE***

Linux sees these all as distinct and separate files.

Also be aware of case sensitivity when dealing with command line options. For instance with the command ls there are two options s and S both of which do different things. A common mistake is to see an option which is upper case but enter it as lower case and wonder why the output doesn't match your expectation.

- If a directory name is separated by a space, it will be seen as two command line arguments. For a solution, you can use quotes `''` around the directory name and it will then be seen as a single command line argument or you can use backslash `\` between each word.
- `ls -a` to show also hidden files and directories

**Previous commands that I have been using and are very useful daily:**

- `tab` for completion
- `pwd`: Will tell me what directory I am currently in.
- `ls`: Will list the files of the current directory.
- `cd`: Will change the directory.
- `mkdir`: Will make a directory.
- `.` Reference to current directory
- `..` Reference to the parent directory
  - To make a file with a space in between, type the name of the file in single quote, **e.g.,** `'code 401`.
  - **Note:** It is best practice to add an underscore for space instead, **e.g.,** `code_401`.
- `clear`: Will clear the terminal.
- `Command Key + q`: Will quit terminal.
- `touch`: Will create files.
- `cd..`: Will go back one directory.
  - **Note:** To go back another directory just add another dot `.`  (E.g., Go back one directory: `cd..` Go back two directories: `cd...`, etc.)
- `Tree`: To view tree
- `code .`: Open VS Code

## Things I want to know more About

I would like to know more about manual pages, I briefly understand, but I need to look for more resources to practice
