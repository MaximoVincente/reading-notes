# "Android Fundamentals" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

### This topic matters because we are going to start our journey as Android developers, and it is important to know the fundamentals prior to starting building apps

1. What is an Intent in Android Studios? Give some fresh examples of when you might use it.
   - The intent is to compile code along with any data and resource files into an APK or an Android App Bundle. In our case we will use Java to write code, where will be able to use it to create features we want our applications to have by compiling it, and using Android Studios tools to style it.
2. Describe an Activity in your own word.
    - An activity would be like a news feed page in a website. When we first go to the news feed page we see all the news feed for our profile, that would be the activity, but in the mobile application. Once you click on a single feed, that will be another activity. This helps to keep track of what the users care about, and ensures that the system keeps running the process that is hosting the activity, and help the app handle having its process killed so the user can return to activities with their previous state restored.

## Things I want to know more about

I will like to know more about broadcast receivers, I think that is an important part to consider when building a mobile application, since there is many broadcast receivers.
