# "Class 12" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

***This topic matters, because prior to this topic, we were only able to dsiplay data through tables, which it is not the best option for every type of available data that needs to be displayed.***

## JavaScript Canvas

1. **What does the `<canvas>` allow a developer to acheive?**
   - `<canvas>` element allows you to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript
2. **What is the importance of the closing `</canvas> tag?**
   - It is needed for fallback content. Any content between the opening and closing tags is fallback content that will display only if the browser doesnâ€™t support the `<canvas>` element.
3. **Explain what the getContext() method does.**
   - Returns a render context object. The `getContext()` takes one argument which is the type of context.

## Chart.js Documentation

1. **What is Chart.js and how it can be brought into your project?**
   - Chart.js is a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5â€™s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. Itâ€™s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.
2. **List 3 different Chart types you can create using Chart.js.**

## Easily Create Stunning Animated Charts with Chart.js

1. **What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?**
   - It is more dynamic. You can display data on a table, but visually, certain data are best displayed in different types of charts. Charts gives you the advantage of displaying the data by using the best chart for the user.
2. **How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?**
   - I would've used a bar chart for the cookie stand, to have a better visual of which stores have the highest or lowest sales.
