# "Data Structures and Algorithms" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

***This topic matters because as developers we need to find efficient solutions, and data structures and algorithm is key to do so***

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
   - You want to use the data sructure that will be the most efficient to solve that particular problem. We can start by identifying the different data structures that we understand and can use for that problem, test it, and see which was most efficient.
2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
   - That there is a base case.

## Things I want to know more about

Binary Search Trees
