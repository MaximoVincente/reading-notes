***Hello Code102! I currently live in Philadelphia, and active Duty in the US Army working with rockets and missiles. I am on the path to become a Software Engineer, and I will make sure to always have a growth mindset throught the process! Below is my GitHub link to follow my progress I am also working on my B.S in Computer Science, although it has been challenging, I enjoy CS very much. Additionally, I have worked with many softwares used in military systems. I enjoy rowing, and the outdoors, specifically Overlanding. Excited to go through this journey with y'all!.***
