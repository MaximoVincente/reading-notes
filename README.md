> ***Growth Mindset for me is the mindset of expecting that there will be challenges on what you are trying to learn or accomplish, but understanding that each challenge can turn in to knowledge.*** 




I believe that growth mindset can be accomplished by:

- Remembering that it is just a temporary hurdle, and I will see the positive outcome at the end!
- Being curious
- Understanding that you do not know everything, "yet"!

### Reading Notes 📖

- Use # For Header. Additionally, If you add another # the header becomes a smaller font.
- Use > and a space for quotes.
- Use - and a space for unordered list.
- Use the number for ordered lists (i.e., 1. "space"), and once you go to the next line, the following number (2), will automatically populate. 
- Use * for italic
- Use *** for bold and italic
- To link a Url use [] for alt text and () for the URL with no space inbetween alt text [] and URL().
- To add an image, you can drag and drop the image file. 
- To add an emoji, use colon, type name of the emoji, and the close it with another colon. E.g, :"insert emoji name here": 
   - Note: Once you type the : and the first letter, you will get a list of emojis to scroll through.
