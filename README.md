> ***Growth Mindset for me are the challenges, on what you are trying to learn or accomplish, but understanding that each challenge will turn into knowledge, to achieve your end state.*** 

I believe that growth mindset can be accomplished by:

- Remembering that it is just a temporary hurdle, and I will see the positive outcome at the end!
- Being curious
- Understanding that you do not know everything, "yet"!

***Hello Code102! I currently live in Philadelphia, and active Duty in the US Army working with rockets and missiles. I am on the path to become a Software Engineer, and I will make sure to always have a growth mindset throught the process! Below is my GitHub link to follow my progress I am also working on my B.S in Computer Science, although it has been challenging, I enjoy CS very much. Additionally, I have worked with many softwares used in military systems. I enjoy rowing, and the outdoors, specifically Overlanding. Excited to go through this journey with y'all!.***

### Reading Notes 📖

***For Markdown Notes:***

- Use `#` For Header. Additionally, If you add another # the header becomes a smaller font.
- Use `>` and a space for quotes.
- Use `-` and a space for unordered list.
- Use the number for ordered lists **(i.e., `1. space`)**, and once you go to the next line, the following number `2`, will automatically populate. 
- Use `*` for italic
- Use `***` for bold and italic
- To link a Url use `[]` for alt text and `()` for the URL with no space in between alt text `[]` and URL`()`.
- To add an image, you can drag and drop the image file. 
- To add an emoji, use `:`, type name of the emoji, and the close it with another colon. **E.g, `:insert emoji name here:`
   - **Note:** Once you type the : and the first letter, you will get a list of emojis to scroll through. 
   - Here's an [Emoji Cheat Cheat](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md)

***For The Coder's Computer Notes:***

- `pwd`: Will tell me what directory I am currently in.
- `ls`: Will list the files of the current directory.
- `cd`: Will change the directory.
- `mkdir`: Will make a directory.
   - To make a file with a space in between, type the name of the file in single quote, **e.g.,** `'code 102`.
   - **Note:** It is best practice to add an underscore for space instead, **e.g.,** `code_102`. 
- `clear`: Will clear the terminal.
- `Command Key + q`: Will quit terminal.
- `touch`: Will create files.
- `cd..`: Will go back one directory.
   - **Note:** To go back another directory just add another dot `.`  (E.g., Go back one directory: `cd..` Go back two directories: `cd...`, etc.)
- `Tree`: To view tree 
- `code .`: Open VS Code
- install `homebrew` on terminal
- Make sure to install the following commands in your terminal:
   - `code`
   - `git`
      - Configure `Git` and `Github`
      - setup `GitHub` for authentication
   - `node`
   - `npm`
   - `eslint`
   - `tree`   
- Using VS Code is more interactive, and less room for error. Prior to using VS Code, ensure to have all the appropriate extensions.
   - VS Extensions include: 
      - liveserver
      - ESLint
      - markdownlint
      - editorconfig
      - HTML Preview
      - Thunder Client
