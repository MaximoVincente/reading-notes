***Hello Code102! I currently live in Philadelphia, and active Duty in the US Army working with rockets and missiles. I am on the path to become a Software Engineer, and I will make sure to always have a growth mindset throught the process!

Additionally, I have worked with many softwares used in military systems. I enjoy rowing, and the outdoors, specifically Overlanding. Excited to go through this journey with y'all!.***
