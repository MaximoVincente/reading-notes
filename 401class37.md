## Steps to start Auth in Amplify

### In the CLI 

- To start provisioning auth resources in the backend, go to your project directory and execute the command: `amplify add storage`
- Fill the prompted questions
- To push your changes to the cloud, execute the command: `amplify push`

### In the Application

- Add the following dependency to your app's build.gradle along with others you added above in Prerequisites and click "Sync Now" when prompted: (Note: you might already have this dependency: `implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-auth-cognito:2.0.0'`)

```java
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-storage-s3:2.0.0'
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-auth-cognito:2.0.0'
}
```

- To initialize the Amplify Auth and Storage categories you call Amplify.addPlugin() method for each category. To complete initialization call Amplify.configure().

  - Add the following code to your onCreate() method in your application class:

```java
Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSCognitoAuthPlugin());
Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSS3StoragePlugin());
```
