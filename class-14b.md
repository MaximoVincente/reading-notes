## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

***This topic really matters, because in the tech field, there is a high probability that we'll be working on team. Which I think it is why our career field is quickly advancing and changing the world***

Being in the military has already thought me that a mission can only be accomplished as team, and the one's accomplishment, is the team's accomplishment, and vice-versa. I think for those of us in the military, or that were in the military, would agree that the best part of it was the camaraderie, we all shared similar experiences but yet we were all from different backgrounds. We felt safe to share any issues, whether it was personal or work related. This is what makes my experience in the military so fulfilling, and why I am commited to it until my last day, and even then I would still want to be involved externally by helping veterans who want to be in tech.
But not everyone has this experience in the military, and those are the Team A that the article spoke about, individual who think they are better than others, or would use their rank to voice over another. It is easy to say that those team or unit did not do as well. As I was reading "Project Aristotle", it reinforced the psychological safety, plaeyed a major role in the teams, or unit that I have been in, and were very successful. I really enjoy working in a team, and even with just the remo classroom, it has made my experience in learning and becoming a dev, much better. I enjoy have conversations with my classmates, figuring out bugs together, and the conversations that deviate from the assignment lol. This is a topic that I will always remember and reinforced throughout my life.
