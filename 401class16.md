# "Spring Security and Auth" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

## Authentication

The main strategy interface for authentication is AuthenticationManager, which has only one method, the authenticate() method, which can:
- Return an `Authentication`
- Throw an `AuthenticationException` if the input represents an invalid principal. It is a runtime exception. It is usually handled by an application in a generic way, depending on the style or purpose of the application. In other words, user code is not normally expected to catch and handle it.
- Return `null` if it cannot decide

### Authentication Implementation 

One important implementation to remember is the `AuthenticationManager` is `ProviderManager`, which delegates to a chain of `AuthenticationProvider` instances.

## Authorization

If authentication is successful, we can move on to authorization, and the core strategy here is `AccessDecisionManager`

### Authorization Implementation

- `AccessDecisionVoter` which considers an Authentication (representing a principal) and a secure Object, which has been decorated with ConfigAttributes.
- `ProviderManager` which delegates to AuthenticationProviders
`AuthenticationProviders` 

I attached the link to the Spring Auth cheetcheat, as reference, because I found it easy to follow, and I know I will be visiting the link often when using Spring Auth.
