# "Purely Functional Programming" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

Purely functional programming usually designates a programming paradigmâ€”a style of building the structure and elements of computer programsâ€”that treats all computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions

Difference between pure and impure functional programming:
- Pure functional programming are:
   - functions like first-class functions and higher-order functions
   - Impure Are persistent
- Impure functional programming: 
  -  Imperative paradigm, such as arrays or input/output methods that use mutable cells, which update their state as side effects
  - some data structures

- Strict vs non strict evaluation
  - Strict Evaluation:
    - It ensures that the programmer does not have to consider in which order programs are evaluated
  - Non Strict Evaluation:
    - Can be implemented much more easily; as all expressions will return the same result at any moment (regardless of program state), their evaluation can be delayed as much as necessary
