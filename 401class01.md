# "Class 01" Reading Notes üìñ

***This topic matters because this is the time most of us had experience JAVA, and it is important to start with the basics to start a strong foundation.

## Java Basics

1. What does ‚Äústrong typed‚Äù mean?
   - Strongly typed is a concept used to refer to a programming language that enforces strict restrictions on intermixing of values with differing data types. When such restrictions are violated and error (exception) occurs.
2. Explain to a non-technical friend the difference in how compilation works in Java and JavaScript.
   - Compilation for a friend: You know in the Matrix when they show a whole bunch of 1s and 0s in lines, imagine you had a machine the can grab all those lines and have a machine that can translate it into something you can understand. The compiler turns all the 1s and 0s into something your computer can understand.

## Things I want to know about

I want tot know more about when to use blocks, and is it similar to a function?
