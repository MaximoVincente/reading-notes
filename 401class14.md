# "Password hashing bcrypt, and jBCrypt" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

Storing passwords is risky and complex. 

One of the password storage method is clear text, is the most basic and the least secure. Storing passwords in cleartext is the equivalent of writing them down in a piece of digital paper. If an attacker was to break into the database and steal the passwords table, the attacker could then access each user account. 

We should not use clear text storage for password storage, instead use hashing. Hashing refers to "chopping something into small pieces" to make it look like a "confused mess". That definition closely applies to what hashing represents in computing.
Using SHA-256, we have transformed a random-size input into a fixed-size bit string. Notice how, despite the length difference between python1990K00L and python, each input produces a hash of the same length. It is widely used for crypto and block-chaining. 

Cryptographic hash functions are practically irreversible, it behaves as one-way functions by using mathematical operations that are extremely difficult and cumbersome to revert such as the modulo operator. 

BCrypt is based on the Blowfish block cipher cryptomatic algorithm and takes the form of an adaptive hash function. Using a Key Factor, BCrypt is able to adjust the cost of hashing. With Key Factor changes, the hash output can be influenced. In this way, BCrypt remains extremely resistant to hacks, especially a type of password cracking called rainbow table.

From my understanding, jBCrypt is the same implementation of BCrypt, but for Java?
