# "OAuth2" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

So far we have learned how to implement the features of:
- "simple" which if you visit the home page with unconditional login with Spring Boot OAuth2, 
- "click" which adds an explicit link that the user has to click to log in
We are now going to learn how to do a "custom error", which adds an error message for unauthenticated users, and a custom authentication 

This was interesting, we can render content on the condition that the user is authenticated, you have the option of either server-side or client-side rendering.

The read shows how to add a logout button, to the application, but what I noticed was that Spring security added a logout button already when the user is authenticated, and signed in. 

## Adding an Error Message

To support the retrieval of an error message, youâ€™ll need to capture it when authentication fails. To achieve this, you can configure an `AuthenticationFailureHandler`
- Here is the cofigure: 

```Java

protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
// @formatter:off
http
// ... existing configuration
.oauth2Login(o -> o
.failureHandler((request, response, exception) -> {
request.getSession().setAttribute("error.message", exception.getMessage());
handler.onAuthenticationFailure(request, response, exception);
})
);
}

```
- We also need to add an `/error` controller like this: 

```Java

@GetMapping("/error")
public String error(HttpServletRequest request) {
	String message = (String) request.getSession().getAttribute("error.message");
	request.getSession().removeAttribute("error.message");
	return message;
}

```
