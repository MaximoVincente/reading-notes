# "JPA and Building Repositories" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

Spring Data Repositories includes:

- CrudRepository provides CRUD functions
- PagingAndSortingRepository provides methods to do pagination and sort records
- JpaRepository provides JPA related methods such as flushing the persistence context and delete records in a batch

If we don't need the full functionality provided by JPA repository, we can use the CRUDRepository

It is important to remember to make a repository as an interface

This is what the CRUD funcionality looks like:

- save(â€¦) â€“ save an Iterable of entities. Here, we can pass multiple objects to save them in a batch
- findOne(â€¦) â€“ get a single entity based on passed primary key value
- findAll() â€“ get an Iterable of all available entities in database
- count() â€“ return the count of total entities in a table
- delete(â€¦) â€“ delete an entity based on the passed object
- exists(â€¦) â€“ verify if an entity exists based on the passed primary key value

To start data with JPA we need to:

- Start Spring Initializer
- Define a simple entity
- Create simple quotes
- Create an application Class
- Build an executable JAR
