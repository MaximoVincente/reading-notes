# "Programming with JavaScript" Reading Notes ğŸ“–

- TheÂ control flowÂ is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
- Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.
- Conditional structure
  - `if` `else`
- You can call functions you create for your conditions.
- Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.
- A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
  functionÂ toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
Â Â returnÂ (5/9) * (fahrenheit-32);
  }
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTMLÂ = toCelsius(77);
  25 Celsius
- Using the example above,Â toCelsiusÂ refers to the function object, andÂ toCelsius()Â refers to the function result.Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.
    functionÂ toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
    returnÂ (5/9) *(fahrenheit-32);
         }
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTMLÂ = toCelsius
  function toCelsius(f) { return (5/9)* (f-32); }
- Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.
- Variables declared within a JavaScript function, becomeÂ LOCALÂ to the function. Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.
- There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purelyÂ evaluate.The expressionÂ `x = 7`Â is an example of the first type. This expression uses theÂ =Â operatorÂ to assign the value seven to the variableÂ x. The expression itself evaluates toÂ `7`. The expressionÂ `x = 7`Â is an example of the first type. This expression uses theÂ =Â operatorÂ to assign the value seven to the variableÂ x. The expression itself evaluates toÂ `7`.
- TheÂ precedenceÂ of operators determines the order they are applied when evaluating an expression.
