# "Class 14" Reading Notes 📖

## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
   - The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.
2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
   - I think Patricia Ordonez's story is a perfect example why. The assumption that everyone grew up with a computer, especially in a computer Science field that was predominately male in her class put her at a disadvantage, if only the proferssor didn't assume that everyone knew how to use a computer, and started from teaching the basics, who know what Ordonez could've accomplishe in lieu with her math skills.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?
   - Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.
2. Why do diverse companies perform better?
   - Given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes. In a 2011 study of diversity in the top firms in Standard & Poor's Composite 1500 list, researchers found “female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.”
3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
   - When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.
