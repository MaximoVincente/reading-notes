# "Google App Publishing Guide" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

***This topic matters because we want to be able to deploy applications that we make to our users, and this is the way to do so. Additionally, we will know the process if we are given the task to do so in our future jobs.***

1. How are releases and versioning related?
   - Releases and versions of the applications related. During the preparation step you have to build a release version of your application, which users can download and install on their Android-powered devices. You release the application to users, and during the release step you publicize, sell, and distribute the release version of your application to users.
2. What are the 5 main tasks you need to complete to prepare your application for release to the Google Play Store?
   - Configuring your application for release. At a minimum you need to remove Log calls and remove the android:debuggable attribute from your manifest file. You should also set your app's version information. You might also have to configure several other settings to meet Google Play requirements or accommodate whatever method you're using to release your application.
   - If you are using Gradle build files, you can use the release build type to set your build settings for the published version of your app.
   - Building and signing a release version of your application. You can use the Gradle build files with the release build type to build and sign a release version of your application. See Building and Running from Android Studio.

   - Testing the release version of your application. Before you distribute your application, you should thoroughly test the release version on at least one target handset device and one target tablet device.

   - Updating application resources for release. You need to be sure that all application resources such as multimedia files and graphics are updated and included with your application or staged on the proper production servers.

   - Preparing remote servers and services that your application depends on. If your application depends on external servers or services, you need to be sure they are secure and production ready.
