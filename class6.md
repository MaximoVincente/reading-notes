# "Activate Web Pages with JavaScript" Reading Notes 📖

- `var`: variables
- const: Always declare with `const`
- Identifiers are the unique name given to variables.
- Assignment Operator:
  - `=`: Is an assignment not and **equal**
  - Equal operator is `==`
- Strings are written inside `’’` or `””`
- It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.
- A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.
- If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.
- If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.
- Link `<script src = file.js></script>`
- `document.write()` to print
