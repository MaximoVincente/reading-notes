Software objects are conceptually similar to real-world objects: they too consist of state and related behavior. An object stores its state in fields (variables in some programming languages) and exposes its behavior through methods (functions in some programming languages). Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication. 
There are benefits for bundling code: 
- Modularity: It can be written and maintained independently of the source code of other objects
- Information hiding: the details of the internal implementation remains hidden from the outside world
- Code re-use: If an object already exists, we can use that object in our program
- Pluggability and debugging ease: It is more simple to debug or remove an object if it is problematic, and replace it with another object

A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created. A Class does not need a main method, because it is not a complete application, as mentioned, it is a blueprint that might be used in an application

Classes can have sub-class and a keyword to identify it is "extend". It inherits all the fields and methods of a class, plus the ones created in the subclass.
