## An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint

***This topic matters because as we get introduced to client/server side, this is a very important area to know and understand***

1. What is node.js?
   - Node.js¬Æ is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome‚Äôs V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google‚Äôs V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
2. In your own words, what is Chrome‚Äôs V8 JavaScript Engine?
   - It compiles JavaScript to to machine code that our computer can understand. I reminds me of the process of C.
3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
   - It means that we can use it to execute JavaScript on our computers.
4. What is npm?
   - It is the package manager for Javascript. And world‚Äôs largest software registry, which meands many code packages to access.
5. What version of node are you running on your machine?
   - 16.7.1
6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?
   - Npm 8.15.0
7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‚Äòjshint‚Äô?
   - Npm install -g jshint
8. What is node used for?
   - Installing and running various build tools, designed to automate the process of developing a modern Javascript application.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
   - Greater Efficiency
   - Engaged Collaboration
   - Lerning from Fellow Students
   - Social Skills
   - Job Interview Readiness
   - Work Environment Readiness
2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
   - Engaged Collaboration, ans greater efficiency.
3. How does pair programming work?
   - While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the ‚Äúmechanics‚Äù of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and‚Äîof course writing‚Äîcode. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
