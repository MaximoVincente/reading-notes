# "Open Source Software Contributions" Reading Notes üìñ

## Important Resources for Open Source Contributions: 

- [First contributions](https://github.com/multunus/first-contributions) is a hands-on tutorial that walks you through contributions workflow on GitHub. When you complete the tutorial, you have made a contribution to the same project.
- [https://up-for-grabs.net](https://up-for-grabs.net/) is a site that aggregates (rolls up and makes easy to explore) projects that actively want help. They label those projects with things like ‚Äúup-for-grabs‚Äù, ‚Äújump-in‚Äù or ‚Äúhelp wanted.‚Äù
- [goodfirstissues.com](https://goodfirstissues.com/) is a site that aggregates the latest issues with the label ‚ÄúGood First Issue‚Äù, which is a GitHub feature for finding easy issues to tackle (see here). goodfirstissues.com empowers first-time contributors to find and select issues that they want to solve.
- [goodfirstissue.dev](https://goodfirstissue.dev/) curates easy pickings from popular open-source projects, and helps you make your first contribution to open-source.
- [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/) helps you subscribe to your favorite open-source projects and get a new open issue from them in your inbox every day.

From the different resources, it seems like gitHub is the best place to start for Open source contributions, it has the most projects, but most importantly it is a great guide to understand how to contribute if it is your first time.
