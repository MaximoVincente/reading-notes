- `pwd`: Will tell me what directory I am currently in.
- `ls`: Will list the files of the current directory.
- `cd`: Will change the directory.
- `mkdir`: Will make a directory.
  - To make a file with a space in between, type the name of the file in single quote, **e.g.,** `'code 102`.
  - **Note:** It is best practice to add an underscore for space instead, **e.g.,** `code_102`.
- `clear`: Will clear the terminal.
- `Command Key + q`: Will quit terminal.
- `touch`: Will create files.
- `cd..`: Will go back one directory.
  - **Note:** To go back another directory just add another dot `.`  (E.g., Go back one directory: `cd..` Go back two directories: `cd...`, etc.)
- `Tree`: To view tree
- `code .`: Open VS Code
- install `homebrew` on terminal
- Make sure to install the following commands in your terminal:

  - `git`
    - Configure `Git` and `Github`
    - setup `GitHub` for authentication
  - `node`

  - VS Extensions include:
    - liveserver
      - ESLint
      - markdownlint
      - editorconfig
      - HTML Preview
