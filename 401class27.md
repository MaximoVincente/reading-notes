# "Android Shared Preferences, Testing with Espresso, and Back Stack" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

***This topic matters because just like Spring, it is important to test everything we build, to ensure that it functions as intended***

1. What is a technology youâ€™ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?
   - Shared preferences are similar to objects, we can store different data types as key value pairs.
2. Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.
   - The most important reason is to ensure that the application functions as intended for the user
   - To test the run speed of the application
   - To ensure the user can visually see the elements or contents intended on the screen
   - To ensure that  the application is running efficiently
3. Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.
    - Something very similar for tasks and back stack that we have used is the stack data structure. The task activity would be the values pushed in the stack, and it also is last in first out. 
    - It can also be like the undo feature, if that was a stack every time you undo, you are removing a task from the stack until you have no more undo, and now the back stack is empty. 

## I would like to know more about

I would like to know more about creating an activity instance.
