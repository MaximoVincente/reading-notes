## HTML Video Audio Content

1. **Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.**
   - When we first started using videos and audio in the web, we had to have silverlight or flash, now we have the `<video>` and `<audio>` elements, and even better, JavaScript to control them! Additionally, we have simpler ways to implement an audio or video file nowadays.
2. **Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the `<video>` element.**
   - The `<video>` element allows you to embed a video very easily.
     - `src` In the same way as for the `<img>` element, the src (source) attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. It works in exactly the same way.
     - `controls` Users must be able to control video and audio playback (it's especially critical for people who have epilepsy.) You must either use the controls attribute to include the browser's own control interface, or build your interface using the appropriate JavaScript API. At a minimum, the interface must include a way to start and stop the media, and to adjust the volume.
3. **Why is it important to have fallback content inside the `<video>` element?**
   - It allows us to provide a content for when browsers do not support the video. This can be anything you like; in this case, we've provided a direct link to the video file, so the user can at least access it some way regardless of what browser they are using.
4. **Write a very short story where `<audio>` and `<video>` are characters.**
   - Once upon a time in the land of  "The Internet Browser", there were words and images in a box, everyone enjoyed reading the words and and seeing images describing the words. One day, a meteor hit the box, and when everyone gathered, to see if the box was ok, the box was emmiting the sounds words and the images were moving at the same speed of the sounds, displaying what the words described. This changed the Internet Broswer forever, and since then the box has evolved.
