# "AWS One-to-Many and Many-to-One Connections" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

1. Describe asynchronous actions in your own words.
    - Asynchronous actions allows our program to do multiple things at once at the same time. It does not block the flow, when a function with a longer runtime is called. 
2. What is the benefit of asynchronous methods?
   - Users can do multiple things at once. By using asynchronous users can decouple tasks and components and it results in a better overall performance of the application.



***Found this really easy to understand explanation for async:***
- Async:
  - Single thread: I put the egg to boil and set a timer, I put the bread to toast and start another timer, when they are done, I can eat. In asynchronous I donâ€™t have to wait for a task to be done in order to start one other task.
  - Multi-thread: I hire 2 cooks and they will boil the egg and toast the bread for me. They can do it at the same time, neither they have to wait for one to finish in order for the other one to start.
