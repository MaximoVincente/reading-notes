# "Operators and Loops" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

- Assignment: x = f()
- Addition assignment: x += f()
- Subtraction assignment: x -= f()
- Multiplication assignment: x *= f()
- Division assignment: x /= f()
- Remainder assignment: x %= f()
- Exponentiation assignment: x **= f()
- Left shift assignment: x <<= f()
- Right shift assignment: x >>= f()
- Unsigned right shift assignment: x >>>= f()
- Bitwise AND assignment: x &= f()
- Bitwise XOR assignment: x ^= f()
- Bitwise OR assignment: x |= f()
- Logical AND assignment: x &&= f()
- Logical OR assignment: x ||= f()
- Logical nullish assignment: x ??= f()

- If an expression evaluates to anÂ object, then the left-hand side of an assignment expression may make assignments to properties of that expression.

- For more complex assignments, theÂ destructuring assignmentÂ syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to extract data from arrays or objects using a syntax that mirrors the construction of array and object literals.
const foo = ['one', 'two', 'three'];

  - // without destructuring
  - const one   = foo[0];
  - const two   = foo[1];
  - const three = foo[2];
  - // with destructuring
  - const [one, two, three] = foo;
- Comparison operators
  - Equal:Â (==)
  - Not equal: (!=)
  - Strict equal:Â (===)
  - Strict not equal:Â (!==)
  - Greater than:Â (>)
  - Greater than or equal:Â (>=)
  - Less than:Â (<)
  - Less than or equal:Â (<=)
- AÂ forÂ loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScriptÂ forÂ loop is similar to the Java and CÂ forÂ loop.
- AÂ whileÂ statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates toÂ true.
