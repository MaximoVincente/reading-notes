# "Java OO, Static Keyword, and Singleton Class" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

1. What is the difference between an Object and a Class in Java?
   - An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior, and a class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
2. What is a Design Pattern? Describe one or two with analogies from your previous work experience.
   - Design patterns are like standard operating procedures already created. The is no need to create a new SOP, for the same thing, when there is already one built for us. 
3. Static methods are also called what? Why?
   - They are also called class methods, because a static method belongs to the class rather than the object of a class.
