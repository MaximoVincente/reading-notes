> ***Growth Mindset for me are the challenges, on what you are trying to learn or accomplish, but understanding that each challenge will turn into knowledge, to achieve your end state.***

I believe that growth mindset can be accomplished by:

- Remembering that it is just a temporary hurdle, and I will see the positive outcome at the end!
- Being curious
- Understanding that you do not know everything, "yet"!

### Markdown Reading Notes ðŸ“–

- Use `#` For Header. Additionally, If you add another # the header becomes a smaller font.
- Use `>` and a space for quotes.
- Use `-` and a space for unordered list.
- Use the number for ordered lists **(i.e., `1. space`)**, and once you go to the next line, the following number `2`, will automatically populate.
- Use `*` for italic
- Use `***` for bold and italic
- To link a Url use `[]` for alt text and `()` for the URL with no space in between alt text `[]` and URL`()`.
- To add an image, you can drag and drop the image file.
- To add an emoji, use `:`, type name of the emoji, and the close it with another colon. **E.g, `:insert emoji name here:`
  - **Note:** Once you type the : and the first letter, you will get a list of emojis to scroll through.
