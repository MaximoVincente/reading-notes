# "Amplify and Cognito" Reading Notes 📖

## Steps to start Auth in Amplify

### In the CLI 

- To start provisioning auth resources in the backend, go to your project directory and execute the command: `amplify add auth`
- Fill the prompted questions
- To push your changes to the cloud, execute the command: `amplify push`

### In the Application

- Add the following dependency to your app's build.gradle along with others you added above in Prerequisites and click "Sync Now" when prompted:
```java
dependencies {
        implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-auth-cognito:2.0.0'
        }
```
- Add the Auth plugin before calling Amplify.configure. Update the code you added in Prerequisites:
```java
import com.amplifyframework.auth.cognito.AWSCognitoAuthPlugin;
import com.amplifyframework.core.Amplify;

// Add this line, to include the Auth plugin.
Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSCognitoAuthPlugin());
        Amplify.configure(getApplicationContext());
```
