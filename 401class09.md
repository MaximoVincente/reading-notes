# "HTTP Request in Java" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

To do an HTTP request in Java we use the built in class HttpUrlConnection, but now Java provides an API called HttpClientAPI.

#### Steps for an HTTP Request 

- The first step to request an HTTP is to create a url instance using the openConnection() method of the URL class. 
***Note*** The HttpUrlConnection class is used for all types of requests by setting the requestMethod attribute to one of the values: GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, TRACE
- Next we add request parameters, we have to set the doOutput property to true, then write a String of the form param1=valueÂ¶m2=value to the OutputStream of the HttpUrlConnection instance
- Then we set request headers. Adding headers to a request can be achieved by using the setRequestProperty() method.
- Configuring timeouts. HttpUrlConnection class allows setting the connect and read timeouts. These values define the interval of time to wait for the connection to the server to be established or data to be available for reading.
To set the timeout values, we can use the setConnectTimeout() and setReadTimeout() methods
- Handle cookies. The java.net package contains classes that ease working with cookies such as CookieManager and HttpCookie
- Handling Redirects: We can enable or disable automatically following redirects for a specific connection by using the setInstanceFollowRedirects() method with true or false parameter
- Reading the Response: It can be done by parsing the InputStream of the HttpUrlConnection instance.
To execute the request, we can use the getResponseCode(), connect(), getInputStream() or getOutputStream() methods. To close the connection, we can use the disconnect() method
- Reading the response of failed requests
- If the request fails, trying to read the InputStream of the HttpUrlConnection instance won't work. Instead, we can consume the stream provided by HttpUrlConnection.getErrorStream()
- Building the Full Response. We can build it using some of the methods that the HttpUrlConnection instance offers.
