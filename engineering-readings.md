# "Engineering" Reading Notes üìñ

***This topic matters because we are preparing for technical interviews, to soon have to be part of one to get hired. Additionally, it is important to develop the key points mentioned in the readings to become a better developer***

1. What‚Äôs the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
   - My commitment. I am very commited to everything I do, to my family, my team, my work, which leads to growth not only to myself but also to those mentioned.  
2. What are 3 things I‚Äôll start doing to ‚Äúun-stick‚Äù myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
   - Read the problem more than twice. I have noticed that this approach has been very helpful, it is important to understand what is being asked before coding, because if you do not understand the task, then you wont be able to solve it.
   - Planning: I think if I create a plan oh how I will approach every task, it will be very effective. No matter how different a task is, a solid plan will help with any of them
   - Break the tasks or big problems into sub-problems. I definitely have gotten overwhelmed with big tasks, but when broken into sub-tasks, it definitely helps, and the completion of each sub-task give you a sense of accomplishment to keep moving forward. I think tools like trello, definitely helps with this.
