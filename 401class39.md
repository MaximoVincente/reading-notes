# "Android Studio Location" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

Steps to setup Location:

- Setup Google Play services
  - Download and install the Google Play services component via the SDK Manager and add the library to your project. For details, see the guide to Setting Up Google Play Services.
- Specify app permissions
  -Apps whose features use location services must request location permissions, depending on the use cases of those features.
- Create location services client
  - In your activity's onCreate() method, create an instance of the Fused Location Provider Client
```java
private FusedLocationProviderClient fusedLocationClient;

// ..

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        // ...

        fusedLocationClient = LocationServices.getFusedLocationProviderClient(this);
        }
  ```

- Get the last known location
  - `getLastLocation()` method to retrieve the device location.
  - Code: 
```java
fusedLocationClient.getLastLocation()
        .addOnSuccessListener(this, new OnSuccessListener<Location>() {
@Override
public void onSuccess(Location location) {
        // Got last known location. In some rare situations this can be null.
        if (location != null) {
        // Logic to handle location object
        }
        }
        });
```
