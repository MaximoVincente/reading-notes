# "Class 14a" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

***This topic matters, because part of the user experience and interaction is visual. Applying transforms, transitions and animations, will achieve this, and I can only imagine what we can do if we apply JavaScript, to an animation!***

## CSS Transforms

1. **What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?**
   - It allows us in new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. We can rotate value, transform syntax, and we can use the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element.

2. **Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.**
   - I can use the 2d Skew for a logo, visually it looks better, and it add to the user experience, and interaction. It can also be used for an interactive gaming web application, maybe with a click listener to click the image while it is flat, and increase the speed as you get more clicks.

## CSS Transitions & Animations

1. **What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?**
   - It will allow the developer tohave the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.
   - It allows the developer to smooth out value changes in your stylesheets when triggered by interactions like hovering, clicking, and focusing. Unlike real butter, transitions arenâ€™t fatteningâ€”theyâ€™re just a few simple rules in your stylesheet to enrich certain events in your designs.
   - It will allow property changes in CSS values to occur smoothly over a specified duration. This smoothing animates the changing of a CSS value when triggered by a mouse click, focus or active state, or any changes to the element (including even a change on the elementâ€™s class attribute).

2. **How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?**
   - Animations allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

## 8 simple CSS3 transitions that will wow your users

1. **What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?**
   - I think Sara Vieira from the article *8 Simple CSS3 Transitions that will wow your user* said it best "Just a couple of lines of code will give you an awesome transition effect that will excite your users, increase engagement and ultimately, when used well, increase your conversions. Whatâ€™s more, these effects are hardware accelerated, and a progressive enhancement that you can use right now."
2. **How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?**
   - This Topic will help my web applications look less like a magazine page, and more like an application that users want to revisit, interact with, and have a positive user experience.
