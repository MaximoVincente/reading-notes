## How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
   - He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internetâ€¦ and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.
2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
   -REST
4. What does a GET do?
   - The client gets  what was requested, or to retrieve information.
5. What does a POST do?
   - If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST
6. What does PUT do?
   - If a system wants to replace something in another system.
7. What does PATCH do?
   - To do a partial update.
