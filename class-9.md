## Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?
   - Functional programming is a programming paradigm â€” a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs â€” that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
   - Pure function returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
   - It does not cause any observable side effects.
4. What is immutability?
   - When data is immutable, its state cannot change after itâ€™s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you canâ€™t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.
5. What is Referential transparency?
   - A function that consistently yields the same result for the same input

## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

1. What is a module?
   - Piece of code of  an application. It allows use to write our code in different modules, instead of all in one file like we typically se in an app.js file
2. What does the word â€˜requireâ€™ do?
   - It allows us to use a function that is in another module. It is also important to note, to use export.

Examples of when to use a pure function, and demo.
