# "Class 10" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

***This topic matters, since we experience bugs everyday and will continue to do so. The best was to debug is understanding what is causing it, or what type of error it is. If you understand the error, than the debugging will be less challenging***

## Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. **Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**
   - Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!
   - Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.
2. **List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**
   - Both syntax and logic errors. Although syntax are much simpler to fix than syntax.
3. **How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**
   - I think what would mainly help me, is to better understand the different types of error. If I know what the error is, then I can get to the solution much faster.

## The JavaScript Debugger

1. **How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**
   - It is a tool the will help you betther understand what the error is, and help you understand better what each line of code is doing.
2. **Define what a breakpoint is.**
   - It is where you want to pause the execution(the line where you want to puse the debugger).
3. **What is the call stack?**
   - The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.

## Things I want know more about

I want to learn more on how to use the browser developer to debug JS when working with  the DOM.
