# "Java Imports and Arrays" Reading Notes ðŸ“–

***This topic matters because***

1. Which loops use a loop counter?
   - A for loop
2. Describe 3 built-in methods for Arrays.
   - public static void sort(Object[] a)
     - Sorts the specified array of objects into an ascending order, according to the natural ordering of its elements. The same method could be used by all other primitive data types ( Byte, short, Int, etc.)
   - public static void fill(int[] a, int val)
     - Assigns the specified int value to each element of the specified array of ints. The same method could be used by all other primitive data types (Byte, short, Int, etc.)
   - public static int binarySearch(Object[] a, Object key)
     - Searches the specified array of Object ( Byte, Int , double, etc.) for the specified value using the binary search algorithm. The array must be sorted prior to making this call. This returns index of the search key, if it is contained in the list; otherwise, it returns ( â€“ (insertion point + 1)).
3. Use an analogy to explain Built-In packages. Give examples.
   - Built-in packages are like standard features that come with your new car, it is ready for you to be used.
